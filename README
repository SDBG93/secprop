Legend:
All symbols used in the calculations are standard symbols.

Ax - Cross-sectional area.
D - Diameter (Outer), or Depth.
B - Breadth.
t - Wall thickness.
Cy, Cz - Distances to centroid in y and z directions respectively.
Iy - Moment of inertia (Second moment of area) about y - y axis.
Iz - Moment of inertia (Second moment of area) about z - z axis.
J, K - Polar moment of inertia (torsional constant).
ry, rz - Radii of gyration  about y - y and z - z axes respectively.
Sy, Sz - Elastic section moduli about y - y and z - z axes respectively.
Zy, Zz - Plastic section moduli about y - y and z - z axes respectively.
SFy, SFz - Shape factors about  y - y and z - z axes respectively.

Note: All moments of inertia are with respect to the section's geometric centroid.
